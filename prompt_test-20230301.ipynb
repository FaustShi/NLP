In addition, it has high thermal conductivity, high damping capacity, and good biocompatibility, which have attracted considerable interest over the past two decades for potential use in diverse applications. However, owing to the limited number of independent slip systems originating from their hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structure and the development of a strong basal texture during thermomechanical processing, Mg alloys usually exhibit poor formability at room temperature (RT). Moreover, they exhibit high susceptibility to corrosion, which further impedes widespread applications.'),\n",

Fig.11 shows the formability and thermal conductivity of various Mg sheet alloys, including pure Mg, commercial AZ31, and experimental Mg–Zn-based alloys.

      "text:The aforementioned studies share these two findings that the LPBF fabricated Al/Al alloys show (i) negligible anisotropy of thermal conductivity and (ii) lower thermal conductivity than that of their wrought counterparts in the as-built condition. Although the former eliminates the need for any post-process heat treatments, the latter makes its implementation inevitable. This study proposes an easily attainable solution to obtain high thermal conductivities for the LPBF fabricated pure Al, AlSi12 (Al-Si binary alloy), and AlSi10Mg (Al-Si-Mg ternary alloy) in the as-built condition and eliminate/alleviate the need for time-consuming and cost-prohibitive post-build heat treatments. The microstructural features of the LPBF fabricated pure Al, AlSi12, and AlSi10Mg parts under the proposed processing condition were examined at nano- to micron-scale and compared to their wrought/cast counterparts as well as the LPBF fabricated parts in the literature. Different factors governing the thermal conductivity of the fabricated pure Al/Al alloys were fundamentally explored and calculated in terms of the electron mean free path. This study fills the knowledge gap in understanding the underlying reasons for the observed thermal behavior of most versatile LPBF fabricated Al/Al alloys for thermal applications and makes their industrial implementation as end-use products more feasible without needing post-build heat treatment.\n",

A gradual increase in thermal conductivity of AlSi10Mg was observed after 300 °C, which finally levels off above 350 °C.

These values were enhanced to 240 and 180 W/mK after heat treatment. However, in this study, the thermal conductivity of the as-built pure Al was almost equal to that of the heat-treated case (∼230 W/mK at room temperature). Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the as-built AlSi10Mg in preheated conditions was ∼80% higher than that of its non-preheated counterpart. For AlSi12, the preheated sample (this study) showed ∼25% higher thermal conductivity than its non-preheated counterpart (115 W/mK) in the as-built state. Therefore, this study has borne out the possibility of 200 °C of preheating to enhance the thermal conductivity of the as-built samples. It must be highlighted that the whole difference observed between the thermal conductivity of the LPBF-fabricated samples in preheated (this study) and non-preheated (literature) conditions is not merely attributable to the preheating. This is because the process parameters, powder attributes, and oxygen content of the printed samples in this study were not identical to those of the previous studies in the literature. By considering the thermal conductivity for the LPBF-fabricated AlSi10Mg in different studies, values of 90 , 119 , and 130 W/mK (along the building direction) were reported for the non-preheated condition.

      "text:Heat can be transferred either by electrons or lattice vibrations (phonons as heat carriers). In metallic materials, the main mechanism governing the heat transfer is the movement of valance electrons with high energy from the warmer regions to the cooler ones . During their journey, electrons face obstacles known as scattering sites. The scattering phenomena can be divided into two categories of intrinsic and extrinsic events . While intrinsic scattering events such as thermally-induced vibration of atoms (phonon scattering) are mainly material-dependent , the extrinsic ones are highly sensitive to the processing condition. Referring to the microstructural features shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10, along with the XCT results (Fig. 2), the extrinsic scattering sites in the LPBF-fabricated Pure Al, AlSi12, and AlSi10Mg alloys are (i) Si element in the supersaturated α-Al matrix in Al alloys, (ii) non-equilibrium vacancies and dislocations, (iii) nano-size Si and Mg2Si precipitates in the cell regions of AlSi10Mg, (iv) copious cell boundaries due to the formation of an ultrafine, textured, divorced eutectic cellular microstructure in Al alloys, (v) oxides in pure Al, (vi) grain boundaries, and (vii) porosities. The mean free path is the average distance between two consecutive scattering sites. The electron mean free path ( l e ) can be calculated as follows : where V F and τ are the velocity of electrons above the Fermi level and the average time between two subsequent electronic collisions, respectively. The V F in Eq. (4) can be calculated by: in which E f and m e are the Fermi energy and mass of electrons, respectively. τ in Eq. (4) can be calculated as follows : in which ρ , n , and e are the electrical resistivity, number of atoms per volume, and electron charge, respectively. ρ in Eq. (6) can be accurately estimated by the Wiedemann-Franz law as : in which T is the absolute temperature, K is thermal conductivity, and k is the Boltzmann constant. By using Eqs. (4)–(7) and the input data provided in Table 1, l e can be calculated. Depending on the input data, either the intrinsic or combination of intrinsic and extrinsic scattering events can be taken into account. For instance, upon using the theoretical data available in the literature for highly pure and defect-free pure Al with equilibrium microstructure and large grains, the l e value would only represent the intrinsic scattering (phonon scattering) during the heat transfer. However, for the LPBF-fabricated parts, the obtained l e is the aftermath of both intrinsic and extrinsic scattering phenomena. Since the literature has proven that the contribution of phonons as heat carriers (not as scattering sites) is negligible in pure Al , it is not considered in the calculations provided in Table 1 for Al/Al alloys.\n",

      "text:Some important inferences can be drawn from the mean free path calculation results in Table 1. First, the l e of the LPBF-fabricated pure Al (16.2 nm) is considerably greater than those of AlSi10Mg (11.1 nm) and AlSi12 (9.7 nm). The l e values are consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, in which materials with smaller l e values showed lower thermal diffusivity and conductivity. The absence of foreign atoms in pure Al is the main reason behind its higher l e and thermal diffusivity/conductivity compared to the Al alloys. Second, based on the theoretical calculations for pure Al, in which the scattering events are only dictated by intrinsic phenomena, the l e value is in the nanometer length scale. On this account, it can be inferred that extrinsic scattering phenomena at such length scales or smaller could have a major influence on the obtained overall mean free path in the LPBF-fabricated parts. Finally, the theoretical l e value for pure Al was ∼15% lower than the one calculated for the LPBF-fabricated pure Al, meaning that the extrinsic scattering phenomena are not extremely strong in this case.\n",

Referring to GND density measurement results provided in section ‎3.2.3, the magnitude of n d for the LPBF-fabricated pure Al, AlSi12 and AlSi10Mg was found to be 4.6 × 10 13 , 1.3 × 10 14 , and 6.5 × 1013 m−2, respectively. Fiks used the following formula to estimate σ d : in which ∆ ρ d * signifies the resistivity per unit dislocation density . The rest of the parameters have the same definition as before and are tabulated in Table 1. Raeisinia et al. experimentally measured the magnitude of ∆ ρ d * for Al at room temperature, the result of which is shown in Table 2. By knowing all the parameters in above equation, σ d and consequently the l dis was calculated for the LPBF-fabricated pure Al, AlSi12, and AlSi10Mg, respectively (Table 2). Finally, l SS Si for AlSi12 and AlSi10Mg alloys was estimated as follows : in which n ss is the number of solid solution Si atoms in the matrix per unit volume and the σ ss is the cross-section for the scattering of the electrons by solid solution atoms. Referring to the point EDS analysis results shown in Fig. 9(k) and Fig. 10(l), 2.4 and 1.9 at% of Si exists in the α-Al matrix of the LPBF-fabricated AlSi12 and AlSi10Mg alloys, respectively. It means that among 100 atoms occupying 25 FCC unit cells (4 atoms per unit cell), 2.4 and 1.9 atoms are Si and the rest of them are Al in the respective materials, based on which n ss was calculated. Couch et al. measured the electron scattering cross section of non-magnetic impurities in Al foils. They reported σ ss values in the range of 0.25–5 × 10−20 m2 for Au, Zn, Mg, Cu and Ag as solid solution impurities. Due to the lack of data on Si, the average value of 3 × 10−20 m2 was used for σ ss calculation. By knowing the n ss and σ ss , the l SS Si was calculated for the LPBF-fabricated AlSi12 and AlSi10Mg, respectively (Table 2). The ( l e ) LPBF values in Table 2 obtained from Eq. (8) are in great agreement with the ones directly calculated from Eq. (4)-Eq.

For pure Al, the rest of the extrinsic scattering sites are more or less affecting the thermal conductivity, and their contribution is not insignificant.

      "text:For Al alloys, the supersaturation of Si in the α-Al matrix is by far the most important extrinsic scattering site with a contribution of 43.3% (AlSi12) and 34% (AlSi10Mg), comparable to that of the intrinsic scattering by phonons. This is the main reason behind the difference observed between the obtained thermal conductivity for AlSi12 (∼140 W/mK) and AlSi10Mg (∼160 W/mK) alloy and their nominal values (170 and 185 W/mK for the respective materials). Among the other factors playing a minor role in the lower thermal conductivity of the AlSi10Mg part, the nano-size Si precipitates within the cells have the highest impact (7.1%). Yet the l Si is one order of magnitude greater than l SS Si and cannot compete with the solid solution Si atoms in terms of scattering strength. In other words, given that there is a mixture between Al and Si elements in an atomic scale in the supersaturated α-Al matrix, these Si atoms are the most detrimental extrinsic scattering sites. This agrees with the findings of a study conducted by Cauwenbergh et al. , which showed that the electrical resistivity of AlSi10Mg was directly proportional to the Si supersaturation level. The overall contribution of dislocations, vacancies, cell boundaries, and Mg2Si (only in AlSi10Mg) to the scattering of electrons was found to be 5.5% and 6.9% for AlSi12 and AlSi10Mg, respectively. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that they did not play a significant role in decreasing the ( l e ) LPBF of LPBF-fabricated Al alloys. Yang et al. suggested that the contribution of cell boundaries in electron scattering cannot be ignored as copious cell boundaries exist within the microstructure of the LPBF fabricated AlSi10Mg alloy. However, the l cb measurements revealed that this value is one order of magnitude greater than the l e value for Al/Al alloys (Table 1) and therefore, its contribution is negligible (Table 2 and Fig. 13) compared to those of the solid solution Si and nano-size Si precipitates.\n",

According to the oxygen content measurements provided in Fig. 11, the optimum pure Al part in this study has 325 ppm oxygen.

The coalescence of the high population of existing nano-size oxides (higher than the oxides of the pure Al sample printed in this study) and a significant increase in their mean chord length in the matrix is another missing factor that can explain such an improvement.
